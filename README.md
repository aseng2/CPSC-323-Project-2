  - Show the content of the stack implementation for each case. Output must be
displayed along the stack implementation

* Requirement: You must write a report file to briefly specify documentation & how to
setup/run your program if needed. Document the code, processes, roles, and
results in this file.

* Requirement: Your submission must have Three (3) files: your design file, your program
